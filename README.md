## 1. Idea / Problem

What exactly do I want to build or solve with this CNC machine? Define the real use-case â€” not just "make a machine", but why and for what.

## 2. Research & Plan

Time to study. What similar projects already exist? What components will I need? Make a parts list, gather reference designs, and plan out the full process step-by-step.


---

## 3. Design (Hardware/Software)

Start designing:

    Hardware â†’ mechanical parts, frame, motors

    Electronics â†’ wiring, drivers, controller board

    Software â†’ firmware, interface, G-code handling

Think both digital and physical.

## 4. Build Prototype

Donâ€™t wait for perfection. Start building with what I have. Use scrap/test parts if needed. Expect mistakes â€” this is for learning and shaping the idea into something real.

## 5. Test & Debug

Run the first tests. Expect issues: motor not moving, wrong axis, loose bolts, bad signals. Go one by one, log what fails, and fix it methodically.

## 6. Improve / Optimize

Now fine-tune. Make it smoother, faster, and more precise. Maybe redesign mounts, tweak code, or add safety features. Every small fix matters.

## 7. Finalize & Document

Once it works well:

    Clean up wiring

    Label components

    Write README, wiring diagrams, code comments

    Prepare to explain it to others or future-me

## 8. Share or Deploy

Set it up for actual use in the lab â€” or publish it. Sharing helps others, and feedback improves the design. Bonus: others might join or support the project.
