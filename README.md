## 1. Idea / Problem  
Start with identifying a problem or a need â€” what should your CNC machine solve or do?

## 2. Research & Plan  
Study existing solutions, define goals, list needed tools/components, and outline steps.

## 3. Design (Hardware/Software)  
Create digital models (CAD), circuit diagrams, and write control software or firmware.

## 4. Build Prototype  
Assemble the machine using available materials. It's okay if it's rough â€” itâ€™s just a start.

## 5. Test & Debug  
Run basic operations. Fix wiring, software bugs, mechanical alignment, or unexpected behavior.

## 6. Improve / Optimize  
Make improvements for speed, accuracy, usability, or safety based on testing results.

## 7. Finalize & Document  
Polish the build, clean up the code, and write documentation (manual, BOM, wiring diagrams).

## 8. Share or Deploy  
Deploy your machine in real-world use â€” or share your design/code online for others to use.
