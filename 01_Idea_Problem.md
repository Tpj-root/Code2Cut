### Why do I need this machine?

 - CNC machines make it easy to build all kinds of products ‚Äî parts, nuts, bolts, and other objects.
 - But the cost of these machines is too high.
 - So, I plan to start learning how to build my own CNC machine from scratch.
 - There are two major components: hardware and software.
 - The best open-source software is [LinuxCNC](https://linuxcnc.org/).
 - The hardware setup is a bit complicated, but not too difficult to manage.




In the next 20 years, a lot of hardware will end up as junk.
Some people will focus on recycling,
but I want to focus on how to reuse it ‚Äî like old chips, motherboards, and displays ‚Äî and use them effectively.

So, I plan to study hardware ‚Äî how it works and how to use it effectively in my spare time.

## 1. Capacitors ‚Äì Filtering & stabilizing voltage

Common **capacitor types** on motherboards (SMD or through-hole):

1. **Ceramic Capacitors**

   * Small, rectangular (SMD), multilayer
   * Used for high-frequency decoupling
   * Values: pF to ¬µF

2. **Electrolytic Capacitors**

   * Cylindrical, usually aluminum
   * Larger values (¬µF to mF), bulk filtering
   * Polarized (has + and -)

3. **Tantalum Capacitors**

   * Small, often yellow or black (SMD)
   * Stable, reliable, compact
   * Polarized, ¬µF range

4. **Polymer Capacitors (Solid Capacitors)**

   * Used in VRM areas (CPU power)
   * Longer life, stable, low ESR
   * Often metallic can-style

5. **MLCC (Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor)**

   * Most common SMD type
   * Very small, high-frequency use




# Capacitor FAQ

## ‚ùì Why are capacitors used?

Capacitors are used to **store and release electrical energy**, and serve several key functions:

- **Filtering**: Smooth out voltage in power supplies (remove ripple).
- **Decoupling/Bypassing**: Remove noise from power lines to ICs.
- **Coupling**: Pass AC signals while blocking DC.
- **Timing**: Used with resistors to create time delays.
- **Stabilizing**: Maintain voltage levels in circuits.

---

## üìç Where are capacitors used?

- **Power supplies**: Smoothing rectified voltage (bulk electrolytics).
- **Motherboards**: Filtering noise near CPU, RAM, chipset (MLCC, polymer).
- **Audio circuits**: Coupling signals between stages.
- **Timers (e.g., 555 IC)**: Setting delay or pulse width.
- **Switching circuits**: Snubbers to protect switches and relays.

---

## ‚è∞ When is a capacitor a must?

- If there's **noise or ripple** in power lines (decoupling).
- When separating **AC signals** from DC bias (coupling).
- For **startup delays** or oscillators (RC timing).
- In high-speed digital circuits (e.g., CPU, GPU VRMs).
- To stabilize **voltage regulators** or DC-DC converters.

## üìè How to choose the correct value?

### Basic rules:

| Purpose        | Typical Value Range | Notes                         |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Decoupling ICs | 0.01¬µF ‚Äì 0.1¬µF      | Place close to IC power pins  |
| Bulk filtering | 10¬µF ‚Äì 1000¬µF       | Larger for more current load  |
| Audio coupling | 1¬µF ‚Äì 10¬µF          | Depends on impedance match    |
| Timing circuits| Depends on R + C    | Use formula `T = R √ó C`       |

### Tips:
- Check **voltage rating**: Use at least **1.5√ó circuit voltage**.
- For power supply: Use **low ESR** types like polymer.
- Place **one ceramic capacitor per IC**, close to its Vcc pin.

---

## üìò Example: Decoupling on Microcontroller

```md
- Use 0.1¬µF ceramic capacitor between Vcc and GND
- Place physically close to the microcontroller‚Äôs power pins



```
For decoupling:

    One leg of the 0.1‚ÄØ¬µF ceramic capacitor goes to Vcc (power)

    Other leg goes to GND (ground)

üìå Place it as close as possible to the power pins of the IC.

This helps filter high-frequency noise before it reaches the IC.
