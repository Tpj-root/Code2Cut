### Why do I need this machine?

```
CNC machines make it easy to build all kinds of products â€” parts, nuts, bolts, and other objects.
But the cost of these machines is too high.

So, I plan to start learning how to build my own CNC machine from scratch.
There are two major components: hardware and software.

The best open-source software is [LinuxCNC](https://linuxcnc.org/).
The hardware setup is a bit complicated, but not too difficult to manage.
