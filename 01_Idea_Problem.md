### Why do I need this machine?

 - CNC machines make it easy to build all kinds of products — parts, nuts, bolts, and other objects.
 - But the cost of these machines is too high.
 - So, I plan to start learning how to build my own CNC machine from scratch.
 - There are two major components: hardware and software.
 - The best open-source software is [LinuxCNC](https://linuxcnc.org/).
 - The hardware setup is a bit complicated, but not too difficult to manage.




In the next 20 years, a lot of hardware will end up as junk.
Some people will focus on recycling,
but I want to focus on how to reuse it — like old chips, motherboards, and displays — and use them effectively.

So, I plan to study hardware — how it works and how to use it effectively in my spare time.
